# Mixed Reality
Exploring new ways to present information to bring people a different experience.

## Hololingo
Demo Video

Purpose

Description

What real world problem it can solve:

## So-Show

# EMG(Emotive) Human Computer Interfaces

## Demo Video

## Purpose
Trying to replace traditional hand control interface such as joy stick, keyboard so people with no lime mobility can be better facilitated.

## Description
Created multiple control signals through facial expressions via Emotive headset toolkit. Implemented modules to filter and process the signals from the devices output.

## Use cases:

### wheelchair

Demo Video:

Description:

Adapted interface modules to integrated signals to wheelchair control so people who can't use their limes(lock-in syndrom???) are still able to have certain mobility.

The wheelchair users are able to navigate through the new interface in relatively complex environments.

### turtle bot
Demo Video:

Description:

Adapted the interface modules to control robot base.

### Internet Explore Interaction
Demo Video:

Description:

Adapted the interface modules to web browsing experience. It provides certain convenience to people who can't use mice and keyboards. Users are able to browser various predefined websites with certain navigation abilities.

# Voice Human Computer Interfaces

A different approach to replace the physical control interfaces(Joystick, keyboard, mouse)

## Wheelchair

# Robots
## DARPA Atlas

Video Demo:


Purpose:

Accepted the three-door task as part of the DARPA challenge 2013.

It requires the robot to locate three doors and open them then go through each one.

Description:

Used point cloud data collected through a rotating 360 lidar sensor. The robot was able to identify the doors and their handles position. Then the human operators are able to control the robot to open and walk across the doors.

## Low Cost Lidar system
Picture:


Purpose:

Build a system that can do a 360 degrees range of detection. This is designed as an alternative of an expensive 360 lidar to lower the cost for $3000 to less than $300.


## In House Medical Care Monitor Robots

Video:

Purpose:

Build a medical care monitor system that can be deployed to patients' houses after they are discharged from hospital for follow up medical care. The doctors are able to observe multiple patients remotely without leaving hospital.


# Utilize Internet Resources
## VOCVOV: Vocabulary learning application

Purpose:

Encouraging language learning by bringing in related internet resources to the learners. Examples such as pictures, movie clips and nemonic rules.

Demo:

##

Purpose:

Enable conversation between strangers to quickly find out their shared interests or common careers.

Description:

Processing and analysis user's public online profile and generate related conversation before talk to each other in person. It helps to open the initial dialogs and helps people to quickly find the desired audience which will improve the overall interaction between people.
