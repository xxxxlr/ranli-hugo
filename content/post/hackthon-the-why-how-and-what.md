# Hackathon, the what, how and why

## What
Extremely limited resource, normally 2 days with only 3-5 teamates working with fresh new technologies for prototyping a new idea.

## How
- At begginning, form a team with a balance of creativity of ideas and abilities of protential teamates.
- Implementing ideas with plan sharing through teamates, asking for help to quick learn how to do things and take notes for retrospection afterwards.
- Prepare a 'Wow' presentation of the final product.
- Asking feedbacks, perticually to stinulat a conversition that generate further attractive ideas based on their tech background, project experience and industry views.

## Why
- There's no better situation and stage that is tailered for training the ability of conflict resolving between teammates and peacefully consolidate to a shared plan.

- There's no better jump starter when you can work with someone who has done related work for a while, either from teammates or the evengelists on site.

- There's very less long term consiqunciese.

## Measure the results
- tech notes
- ideas learned
- presentation skills
- friends made
- team management flow
