# Why

Hey man,

I promise you I can get it for you, because I truly believe I can deliver it. But I do need a minute to get back to you.

Then you can do what you want with it.

However...I might, just might, fail...But can you catch me if I do? Just to keep me honest.


Promise.

Thanks!

# How
- create
- resolve
- reject
- catch
- then
- chain

@Core: How to handle callback without nesting on into another.

@Solution: a _flat_ schedule ahead of time with a planning chain.

@Complication:


# What
Register a callback H, then based on the result of H react with another callback E, then with another callback L. And there's L.

Overall: H->E->L->L

# Use cases

    - Angular
    - Observable
# Native VS Lib(q, bluebird)
# Promise vs Observable
